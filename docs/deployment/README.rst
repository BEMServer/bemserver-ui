Deployment documentation
========================

The files in this directory may be used to configure bemserver-ui with Nginx
and uwsgi. Some choices here are opinionated. Users are free to adapt them to
their own needs.

Copy `etc` and `srv` to server `/`.

Then edit configuration files. At least the lines marked with a `TODO` comment.
